publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

    - assets/images/menu.jpg
    - assets/images/normas.jpg
    - assets/images/dds.jpg

    - assets/images/datas.jpg
    - assets/images/historia.jpg
    - assets/images/tecnico.jpg
    - assets/images/nbr.jpg
    - assets/images/ppp.jpg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Segoe
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/segoeresgular.ttf
    - family: Segoe Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/segoebold.ttf
    - family: Segoe Black
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/segoeblack.ttf
    - family: Segoe Light
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/segoelight.ttf
